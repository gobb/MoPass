# MoPass #

MoPass is a password manager. You can store all your password/personal data, then encrypt it using a master password.

Basicaly, it is just a bunch of static files (it doesn't need a webserver). You can put them in your Dropbox, open them on your mobile, any kind of computer... your data is safe (encrypted) and universally readable (you just need a web browser).

## Note on browser support ##

At the moment it relies on jQuery 1.9.1, compatible with IE 6/7/8.
